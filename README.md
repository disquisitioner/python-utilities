python-utilities
================

Assorted utilities programs written in Python, mostly to make it easier to do interesting things with my Raspberry Pi.

Here's what is here currently...
* Kribensis -- A Python Dropbox client that supports easy file transfer from a local machine to Dropbox, or retrieval of a file from Dropbox.  See `kribensis_README.md` for more details.

* Ephemeris -- Uses the PyEphem package to calculate observational information for the Sun, Moon and planets for observers at any location.  See `ephemeris_README.md` for more details.
