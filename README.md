================

Assorted utilities programs written in Python, mostly to make it easier to do interesting things with my Raspberry Pi.

Here's what is here currently...

* Kribensis - A Python Dropbox Client

I love Dropbox.  Ideally there would be a Dropbox client for Raspberry Pi so easy cross-machine file syncronization would be as automatic for Raspberry Pi as it is for Mac, PC, and Linux systems.  Alas, as of this writing there isn't one.  However, there is a Dropbox SDK for Python.  I therefore decided to write a simple utility that could get/put files between my Raspberry Pi and My Dropbox account.
